Exercise 1
1- It does not print the fruit at the correct index, why is the returned result wrong? 
we cannot assign id to Set data type, because Set change the location of id's.
2- How could this be fixed?
I exchange the data type Set with List and then the problem solved.

Exercise 2
1- Can you spot the obvious error? 
we should make a Copy of "coords" into variable like "new_coords" 
2- After fixing the obvious error it is still wrong,how can this be fixed?
I changed the location of the indexes in the appropriate way to reach the solution.

Exercise 3
1- For some reason the plot is not showing correctly, can you find out what is going wrong? 
2- How could this be fixed?
The X and Y coordinates were reversed, I fixed it in a right way.
